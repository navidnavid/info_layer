# info_layer
the idea:
 calculate the info from macro to micro (n) layers, see how the info content 
 will be changed? the resulst will be signal of n point based in the observer . 
 as for gravity or temperature based on the observer layer , different physics will be appliyed. 
 e.g macro observe see potentioal energy = enrgy lacks due to conversion to info.
 micro observer will not see temprature ( just vabratino ) = kenetic and not info = potential. 

Or why not the info from micro addable to macro ?
 ---
 clasify_num.py -> devide list num to two gropys based on the distance to mean-> macro to micro 
 cal_info.py-> cal etp of signal and max etp of that. 
 ---

 Todo:
 cal culate info = max etp - etp . 
 calc the info dif when going from macro to micro ( each devisions). save it as result. 
 after n devision -> there will be a n layer info diff . 
 what dows that mean ?
